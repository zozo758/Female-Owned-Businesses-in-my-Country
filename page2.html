<h3> TheKakery</h3>

<p class="momo"> The woman behind this business is Kerina Joseph. In her own words she says, "I started off this business as means to pass time and to obtain extra income. Baking has always been something I loved to do from a young age and along the way I learnt the decorating part of it.
I was a secondary school teacher where I worked 8-3, then I also taught part time for a company 4-8pm. When I lost my main job and income I had alot of time on my hands. Eventually I decided to turn my hobbie into a job.
I started off baking mainly for my friends and family. Then I took to social media and set up a page with my work and from there I gained more customers. My products have expanded from just cakes to cheesecakes, cinnon rolls and my most popular product, donuts.
I never thought I would reach this far- 3 years - but it has been an amazing experience." She also told me that being an entrepreneur is not as glamerous as people make it to be. Yes you may work for yourself and your own time but if you as a person do not have the passion to grow your business or simply the drive for the success of your business, it will fail.</p>

For some reason I just couldn't remember what the models had on but I was on a quest to find out.
Fast forward to one day something pulled me to buy wool and I felt like this was no ordinary purchase. Finally I felt complete.
I was very confused, asked myself why was I feeling this way, I've bought wool countless times before.What I unlocked that day was a new episode of my life starring my passion for both crochet and fashion.
I got home watched a tutorial on YouTube and did my first ever peice it was a peach crochet two piece swimsuit."
